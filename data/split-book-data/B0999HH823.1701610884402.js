window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A web API is an efficient way to communicate with an application or service. However, this convenience opens your systems to new security risks. <i>API Security in Action</i> gives you the skills to build strong, safe APIs you can confidently expose to the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Inside, you’ll learn to construct secure and scalable REST APIs, deliver machine-to-machine interaction in a microservices architecture, and provide protection in resource-constrained IoT (Internet of Things) environments.</p> <p><b>About the technology: </b>APIs control data sharing in every service, server, data store, and web client. Modern data-centric designs - including microservices and cloud-native applications - demand a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to security for both private and public-facing APIs.</p> <p><b>About the book: </b><i>API Security in Action </i>teaches you how to create secure APIs for any situation. By following this hands-on guide, you’ll build a social network API while mastering techniques for flexible multiuser security, cloud key management, and lightweight cryptography. When you’re done, you’ll be able to create APIs that stand up to complex threat models and hostile environments.</p> <p><b>What's inside: </b>Authentication + Authorization + Audit Logging + Rate Limiting + Encryption</p> <p><b>About the target audience: </b>for developers with experience building RESTful APIs. Examples are in Java.</p> <p><b>About the author: </b>Neil Madden has in-depth knowledge of applied cryptography, application security, and current API security technologies. He holds a PhD in Computer Science.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. </b></p>";
